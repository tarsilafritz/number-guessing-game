A simple **command-line game** built in Python where you try to guess the number the computer is thinking of.  
This project was created as a way to **practice Python** and reinforce **fundamental programming concepts** such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
Through this project, I aimed to:
- Practice Python syntax and basic structure  
- Reinforce understanding of **variables**, **data types**, and **type conversion**  
- Work with **loops** and **conditional statements**  
- Handle **user input** and prevent program crashes with **error handling**  
  
---

## 🧩 Features
- Random number generation between **0 and 100**
- Validates user input (handles non-numeric guesses)
- Provides feedback for each guess:
  - "Too high" if your guess is above the number
  - "Too low" if your guess is below the number
- Loops until the correct number is guessed 🎉

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### 1. Clone or download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarsilafritz/number-guessing-game.git
cd number-guessing-game
```
### 2. Run the script
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. The program will think of a number between **0 and 100**.
2. Type your guess and press **Enter**.
3. The game will tell you whether your guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.
4. Keep guessing until you find the number!🎯

---

## 💡 Future Improvements (Ideas)
- Count and display the number of attempts
- Add a difficulty system (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Let the player play again after winning
- Build a web version using Flask or a GUI version using Tkinter

## 🧑‍💻 Example Output
```vbnet
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
A simple CLI game built in Python. Let's start!
Hint: it's a number between 0-100

Which number am I thinking of? 50
Too high! Try again.

Which number am I thinking of? 25
Too low! Try again.

Which number am I thinking of? 37
🎉 You are correct! The number is 37.
```

---

## 🐍 Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer
  </br>*No external libraries needed.*
